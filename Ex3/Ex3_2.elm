   In this exercise, two-directional counter will be implemented.
   The initial state of the counter is 0.j
   When user clicks `+1` button, the number will be incremented.
   When user clicks `-1` button, the number will be decremented.

   You will find TODOs below.

   BONUS: Try to change the color of the counter to green when it is positive, blue when equals 0, and red when is negative.

-- TODO 1.
-- Model should be the record with `counter` property of type `Int`


type alias Model =

-- TODO 2.
-- Discriminated union representing the Msg type should also have `Decrement` case

-- TODO 3.
-- Model is no longer an empty record - update initModel accordingly!

-- TODO 4.
-- update function needs to return new model based on the message
-- case expression might be useful and see records update syntax

-- TODO 5.
-- view function takes model and should display current counter value and buttons
-- useful stuff: div, button, text, onClick attribute, toString function (you can always experiment with it in REPL! :)
-- Try to style all elements to make it look a bit nicer!
